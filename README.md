# Objective

The objective of this program is to launch a movie trailer website, allowing viewers to browse my favorite movies and watch their trailers.

# How to Launch

Clone the repository to run on your local machine by typing:

> git clone https://github.com/wickblue/ud036_StarterCode

You must have Python installed on your computer to run these files.

If you do not have Python installed, go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download 

Run the module entertainment_center.py and the movie trailer site will create the HTML file and launch.
